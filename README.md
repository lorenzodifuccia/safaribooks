  * [Example: Use or not the `--kindle` option](#use-or-not-the---kindle-option)

## Requirements & Setup:
First of all, it requires `python3` and `pip3` or `pipenv` to be installed.  
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/lorenzodifuccia/safaribooks.git
Cloning into 'safaribooks'...

$ cd safaribooks/
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt

OR

$ pipenv install && pipenv shell
```  

The program depends of only two **Python _3_** modules:
```python3
lxml>=4.1.1
requests>=2.20.0
```
  
## Usage:
It's really simple to use, just choose a book from the library and replace in the following command:
  * X-es with its ID, 
  * `email:password` with your own. 

```shell
$ python3 safaribooks.py --cred "account_mail@mail.com:password01" XXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

The ID is the digits that you find in the URL of the book description page:  
`https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/book-name/XXXXXXXXXXXXX/`  
Like: `https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/test-driven-development-with/9781491958698/`  
  
#### Program options:
```shell
$ python3 safaribooks.py --help
usage: safaribooks.py [--cred <EMAIL:PASS> | --login] [--no-cookies]
                      [--kindle] [--preserve-log] [--help]
                      <BOOK ID>

Download and generate an EPUB of your favorite books from Safari Books Online.

positional arguments:
  <BOOK ID>            Book digits ID that you want to download. You can find
                       it in the URL (X-es):
                       `https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/book-
                       name/XXXXXXXXXXXXX/`

optional arguments:
  --cred <EMAIL:PASS>  Credentials used to perform the auth login on Safari
                       Books Online. Es. ` --cred
                       "account_mail@mail.com:password01" `.
  --login              Prompt for credentials used to perform the auth login
                       on Safari Books Online.
  --no-cookies         Prevent your session data to be saved into
                       `cookies.json` file.
  --kindle             Add some CSS rules that block overflow on `table` and
                       `pre` elements. Use this option if you're going to
                       export the EPUB to E-Readers like Amazon Kindle.
  --preserve-log       Leave the `info_XXXXXXXXXXXXX.log` file even if there
                       isn't any error.
  --help               Show this help message.
```
  
The first time you use the program, you'll have to specify your Safari Books Online account credentials (look [`here`](/../../issues/15) for special character).  
The next times you'll download a book, before session expires, you can omit the credential, because the program save your session cookies in a file called `cookies.json`.  
For **SSO**, please use the `sso_cookies.py` program in order to create the `cookies.json` file from the SSO cookies retrieved by your browser session (please follow [`these steps`](/../../issues/150#issuecomment-555423085)).  
  
Pay attention if you use a shared PC, because everyone that has access to your files can steal your session. 
If you don't want to cache the cookies, just use the `--no-cookies` option and provide all time your credential through the `--cred` option or the more safe `--login` one: this will prompt you for credential during the script execution.

You can configure proxies by setting on your system the environment variable `HTTPS_PROXY` or using the `USE_PROXY` directive into the script.

#### Calibre EPUB conversion
**Important**: since the script only download HTML pages and create a raw EPUB, many of the CSS and XML/HTML directives are wrong for an E-Reader. To ensure best quality of the output, I suggest you to always convert the `EPUB` obtained by the script to standard-`EPUB` with [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/).
You can also use the command-line version of Calibre with `ebook-convert`, e.g.:
```bash
$ ebook-convert "XXXX/safaribooks/Books/Test-Driven Development with Python 2nd Edition (9781491958698)/9781491958698.epub" "XXXX/safaribooks/Books/Test-Driven Development with Python 2nd Edition (9781491958698)/9781491958698_CLEAR.epub"
```
After the execution, you can read the `9781491958698_CLEAR.epub` in every E-Reader and delete all other files.

The program offers also an option to ensure best compatibilities for who wants to export the `EPUB` to E-Readers like Amazon Kindle: `--kindle`, it blocks overflow on `table` and `pre` elements (see [example](#use-or-not-the---kindle-option)).  
In this case, I suggest you to convert the `EPUB` to `AZW3` with Calibre or to `MOBI`, remember in this case to select `Ignore margins` in the conversion options:  
  
![Calibre IgnoreMargins](https://github.com/lorenzodifuccia/cloudflare/raw/master/Images/safaribooks/safaribooks_calibre_IgnoreMargins.png "Select Ignore margins")  
  
## Examples:
  * ## Download [Test-Driven Development with Python, 2nd Edition](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/test-driven-development-with/9781491958698/):  
    ```shell
    $ python3 safaribooks.py --cred "my_email@gmail.com:MyPassword1!" 9781491958698
