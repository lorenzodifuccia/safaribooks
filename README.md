# SafariBooks
Download and generate *EPUB* of your favorite books from [*Safari Books Online*](https://www.safaribooksonline.com) library.  
I'm not responsible for the use of this program, this is only for *personal* and *educational* purpose.  
Before any usage please read the *O'Reilly*'s [Terms of Service](https://learning.oreilly.com/terms/).  

## Overview:
  * [Requirements & Setup](#requirements--setup)
  * [Usage](#usage)
  * [Example: Download *Test-Driven Development with Python, 2nd Edition*](#download-test-driven-development-with-python-2nd-edition)
  * [Example: Use or not the `--no-kindle` option](#use-or-not-the---no-kindle-option)

## Requirements & Setup:
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/lorenzodifuccia/safaribooks.git
Cloning into 'safaribooks'...

$ cd safaribooks/
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt

OR

$ pipenv install && pipenv shell
```  

The program depends of only two **Python 3** modules:
```python3
lxml>=4.1.1
requests>=2.18.4
```
  
## Usage:
It's really simple to use, just choose a book from the library and replace in the following command:
  * X-es with its ID, 
  * `email:password` with your own. 

```shell
$ python3 safaribooks.py --cred "account_mail@mail.com:password01" XXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

The ID is the digits that you find in the URL of the book description page:  
`https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/book-name/XXXXXXXXXXXXX/`  
Like: `https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/test-driven-development-with/9781491958698/`  
  
#### Program options:
```shell
$ python3 safaribooks.py --help
usage: safaribooks.py [--cred <EMAIL:PASS>] [--no-cookies] [--no-kindle]
                      [--preserve-log] [--help]
                      <BOOK ID>

Download and generate EPUB of your favorite books from Safari Books Online.

positional arguments:
  <BOOK ID>            Book digits ID that you want to download.
                       You can find it in the URL (X-es):
                       `https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/book-
                       name/XXXXXXXXXXXXX/`

optional arguments:
  --cred <EMAIL:PASS>  Credentials used to perform the auth login on Safari
                       Books Online.
                       Es. ` --cred "account_mail@mail.com:password01" `.
  --no-cookies         Prevent your session data to be saved into
                       `cookies.json` file.
  --no-kindle          Remove some CSS rules that block overflow on `table`
                       and `pre` elements. Use this option if you're not going
                       to export the EPUB to E-Readers like Amazon Kindle.
  --preserve-log       Leave the `info_XXXXXXXXXXXXX.log` file even if there 
                       isn't any error.
  --help               Show this help message.
```
  
The first time you use the program, you'll have to specify your Safari Books Online account credentials (look [`here`](/../../issues/15) for special character).
The next times you'll download a book, before session expires, you can omit the credential, because the program save your session cookies in a file called `cookies.json` (for **SSO** look the file format [`here`](/../../issues/2#issuecomment-367726544)). 
  
Pay attention if you use a shared PC, because everyone that has access to your files can steal your session. 
If you don't want to cache the cookies, just use the `--no-cookies` option and provide all time your `--cred`.

You can configure proxies by setting on your system the environment variables `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY`.

The program default options are thought for ensure best compatibilities for who want to export the `EPUB` to E-Readers like Amazon Kindle. If you want to do it, I suggest you to convert the `EPUB` to `AZW3` with [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/).  
You can also convert the book to `MOBI` and if you'll do it with Calibre be sure to select `Ignore margins` in the conversion options:  
  
![Calibre IgnoreMargins](https://github.com/lorenzodifuccia/cloudflare/raw/master/Images/safaribooks/safaribooks_calibre_IgnoreMargins.png "Select Ignore margins")  

In the other hand, if you're not going to export the `EPUB`, you can use the `--no-kindle` option to remove the CSS that blocks overflow on `table` and `pre` elements, see below in the examples.  
  
## Docker

If you don't have or want to setup a python environment but have `docker` installed, you might want to run `safaribooks` within a container. After cloning this repository, the following command will be enough to download whatever `<BOOK ID>` you provide.

```shell
$ docker build . -t safaribooks && \
  docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd)/Books:/safaribooks/Books safaribooks \
    --cred "account_mail@mail.com:password01" <BOOK ID>
```

The above will run build a `safaribooks` docker image locally and run it. Please note the `-v` argument: it'll make the downloaded books available outside of the container. In this example, it'll create a directory called `./Books` on your current directory.

## Examples:
  * ## Download [Test-Driven Development with Python, 2nd Edition](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/test-driven-development-with/9781491958698/):  
    ```shell
    $ python3 safaribooks.py --cred "XXXX@gmail.com:XXXXX" 9781491958698
